 <h1>Balance - Concept Redesign Project</h1>   
 <p>Discovering alternative meditation habit building solutions for calmer minds</p>
 <h2>Context: Balance Is Losing Customers</h2>
 <p>Despite the boom of the meditation industry and related apps in recent years, since the end of pandemic the usage of these apps have been steadily falling. Balance is no exception.
</p>
<p>The company wishes to find out why are users dropping out and if thecollaboration with a brainwave-tracking company, Muse, will help retain customers.
</p>
<h2>The Problem Of Habit Building and How Reward System Fails</h2>
<p>We conducted interviewed with 9 users on experiences with mediation or health tracking apps. A common problem arised following the synthesis of the interview insights. Users find it difficult to stay motivated and build a habit despite the reward system offerings that Balance and other apps provide.
</p>
<p>In the long term, users needs a way to maintain motivation while being guided and cared for in their meditative journey because currently it’s difficult to keep the habit when external circumstances change
</p>
<h2>Industry Insights: Why Alternatives Solutions Are Needed</h2>
<p>A deep dive in to the industry insights provided clues to why the reward system is bound to fail, as there’s an internal friction between meditation and the reward system. This stems from the altered nature of the Buddist ritual in the western corporate world powered by rewards and productivity. Scientifically, meditation also proves to dampen the rewards system in the brain.
</p>
<p>Therefore, an alternative method of habit building is needed. How might we facilitate users’ growth on their meditative journey focusing on internal motivation?
</p>
<h2>Ideation: Mood Journaling & Actionable Brainwave Feedback</h2>
<p>During the ideation stage we sketched different ideas based on the needs and insights from user research.</p>
<p>Muse headband can be useful as it displays biometric data to quantify brain activity to indicate how deep the meditation is. However to further facilitate motivation, we need to consider how to integrate the feature to long term habit building by offering actionable feedback.</p>
<p>The other solution carried forward was mood journaling, beneficial for general self reflection and trend spotting.</p>
<h2>Wireframes & Usability Tests</h2>
<p>For the design, we first only drafted the main pages for the two features to test out the ideas.</p>
<p>Throughout the design process, we reminded ourselves of the goal to facilitate internal motivation and added simple charts for easy data comprehension as well as detailed feedback. Meanwhile we used a friendly tone as well explainations and prompts so users feel cared for, guided and informed.</p>
<p>These pages were tested where users are tasked to interprete the brainwave data and log moods. We further validated the usefulness and added value of the features by asking if users will be interested in subscribing to Balance on payable basis for the features. </p>
<h2>Prototype Iterations & Next Steps</h2>
<p>As users commonly expressed confusion on the usage of the Muse feature, we added onboarding screens for the feature with detailed tutorials. We also redesigned the infographics for easier comprehension of the data.</p>
<p>In addition, we improved the interconnectivity of the two features by enabling mediation reflection and integrating the function to the mood journal pages. Additional tweaks include higher accessibilty of the graphics, alignment of naming, and general refinement of UI.</p>
