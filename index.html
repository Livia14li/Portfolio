    <a href="./balance.html">Balance - Concept Mobile Redesign</a>
    <p>I collaborated with 2 UX designers to reenvision of a mediation app to understand users’ blockers in mediation habit building & assess partnership with a brainwave headband company. We focused on providing actionable biometric feedbacks and qualitative mood journaling to facilitate internal motivation for long term habit building.</p>
    <a href="">House of Books - Concept Ecommerce Redesign</a>
    <p>I independently redesigned a local independent bookshop’s desktop site to allow e-commerce functions. I carefully designed the navigation, page layout, features, typography and colour scheme to provide assurance, exciting and aesthetic experiences and a human touch.</p>
    <a href="">Playmate - Concept Mobile Design</a>
    <p>I independently designed a mobile app for users to easily find suitable sports partners to meet up and play. I discovered distinct feature preferences between different demographics which will be further tested with a large sample size.</p>
    <a href="">Clowns in the Sky - Concept UI Redesign</a>
    <p>I independently redesigned the UI of a children’s charity website to reflect the brand mission and facilitate easier donation and support for afffected families. The distinctly optmistic attitude of the charity was effectively conveyed through the use of bright colours, friendly typography and irregular graphics.</p>
